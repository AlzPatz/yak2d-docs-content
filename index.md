# **yak2D** Documentation

The **yak2D** framework enables the creation of interactive **cross platform** desktop 2D graphics applications.

It offers simple 2D polygon and ‘sprite’ drawing functions, in addition to flexible render path creation making use of shader effects (both inbuilt and user defined).

Quickly create 2D games and prototypes that run on all major desktop operating systems. Graphics, Input, Windowing and Application Lifecycle are all provided for and managed by the framework (*just add sound*). Avoid the bloat of large game engines (or make life harder for yourself - whatever your opinion). No GUI, **do it all in code..** :)

yak2D is structured as a collection of .NET standard 2.0 class libraries, built upon the [Veldrid](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid) cross-platform API agnostic rendering library. Application windowing is handled by SDL2 via [Veldrid](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid).

**Supported Desktop Platforms: Windows, Linux and OSX**

**Supported Graphics APIs: Direct3D 11, Vulkan, Open GL, Metal**
