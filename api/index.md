# API Documentation

The **yak2D** API documentation is automatically generated from source-code-level comments. Only the external user API is documented in this way.

More information (including the internal workings of the framework) can be found within the [source code](xref:https://github.com/AlzPatz/yak2d) itself.

Please also see the [Articles](xref:uid_intro) section for additional guidance on **yak2D** concepts and usage.
